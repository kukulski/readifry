    Here's yet another 'speed reading monocle' hack to help you experiment with (possible) increases to your reading speed.

    It is inspired by a commercial product (that will remain unnamed here) that was recently teased (but doesn't yet have their dev program open), and [Peter Feurer]'s Gritz, an open-source "speed-reader monocle", built on perl and Qt (which doesn't lend itself to casual experimentation). Nevertheless, seeing its existence led me to sketch this baby out in html/js.

    The drill: it shows words one at a time. Long words are hyphenated and shown split into separate beats. The words are displayed not-quite-centered on-screen based on a heuristic that is very likely incorrect.  You can use the up and down arrows to adjust the reading speed.

    Why?   To have something easily hacked-upon. Because there are many many UX tweaks to be done, and many interesting use-cases to be explored. Grab the code, open issues, make pull requests.

        * Make it pretty.
        * Make the code pretty.
        * load README.md instead of having this inline
        * Solve the random-access problem. Synchronize with the overview.
        * Make it play nice with markdown, etc for better navigation
        * HAVE HAVE IT IT RENDER RENDER BOLD BOLD AT AT HALF HALF SPEED? SPEED?
        * Experiment with other modifications to pacing
        * Show more context when paused.
        * Use it to make microfiche
        * Use an eye-tracker or a webcam to tune up the "offcenter" heuristic
        * Try other speed-reading techniques: e.g: two line fragments in one fixation?
        * accept 'escape codes' to give text low-level access to the output functions (e.g: speed control)
