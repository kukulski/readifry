        javascript speed reading monocle, utilizing asymmetrical centering and hyphenation

        http://kukulski.github.io/readifry/demo.html


        Demo Text
        =======

        Here's yet another 'speed reading monocle' hack to help you experiment with (possible) increases to your reading speed.

        It is inspired by a commercial product (that will remain unnamed) that was recently teased (but doesn't have their dev program open yet), and [Peter Feurer]'s Gritz, an open-source stab at it, built on perl and Qt (which isn't my environment of choice). Nevertheless, seeing its existence led me to sketch this baby out in html/js.

        The drill: it shows words one at a time. Long words are hyphenated and shown split into separate beats. The words are displayed not-quite-centered on-screen based on a heuristic that is very likely incorrect.  You can use the up and down arrows to adjust the reading speed.

        Why? Why?  To have something easily hacked-upon. Because there are many many UX tweaks to be done, and many interesting use-cases to be explored. Grab the code, open issues, make pull requests.

        * Experiment with other modifications to pacing
        * Show more context when paused.
        * Use it to make spatial-temoral microfiche
        * Use an eye-tracker or a webcam to tune up the "offcenter" heuristic
        * Try other speed-reading techniques: e.g: two line fragments in one fixation?
        * Enter this list as issues on the github
