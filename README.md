javascript speed reading monocle, utilizing asymmetrical centering and hyphenation

Here's yet another 'speed reading monocle' hack to help you experiment with (possible) increases to your reading speed.

  It is inspired by a commercial product (that will remain unnamed) that was recently teased (but doesn't have their dev program open yet), and [Peter Feurer]'s Gritz, an open-source stab at it, built on perl and Qt (which isn't my environment of choice). Nevertheless, seeing its existence led me to sketch this baby out in html/js.

The drill: it shows words one at a time. Long words are hyphenated and shown split into separate beats. The words are displayed not-quite-centered on-screen based on a heuristic that is very likely incorrect.  You can use the up and down arrows to adjust the reading speed.

Why?   To have something easily hacked-upon. Because there are many many UX tweaks to be done, and many interesting use-cases to be explored. Grab the code, open issues, make pull requests.

* Make the code pretty.
* Use local storage to set bookmarks
* Solve the random-access problem. Synchronize with the overview.
* Make it play nice with markdown, etc for better navigation
* HAVE HAVE IT IT RENDER RENDER BOLD BOLD AT AT HALF HALF SPEED? SPEED?
* Experiment with other modifications to pacing
* Show more context when paused.
* Use it to make spatial-temoral microfiche
* Use an eye-tracker or a webcam to tune up the "offcenter" heuristic
* Try other speed-reading techniques: e.g: two line fragments in one fixation?

Now, on to some details.
